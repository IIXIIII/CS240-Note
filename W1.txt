Intro to tidyverse and data visulization using ggplot:

  {r setup, include=False}
            telling R not include in the output 


  Tidyverse: package make datascience easay 

  instal.packagess("tidyverse")

  library(tidyverse)
  #import the tidyverse package

  library(lubridate) #included in the tidyverse but need to be imported 

  str(matrix) # the structure of the matrix
  dim() # the dimention of the matrix
  nrow #output the row
  ncol # the colomn


  Histogram 

  ggplot(ice) +   #using the ice as the first input of the ggplot
    geon_histogram(aes(x=duration) )    #adding another layer ontop 
                    #aes = the colomn that we care 
                    #this line means to thake the duration colomn from the ice matrix and make it into the x access. 

    #can add different layer on ggplot,
